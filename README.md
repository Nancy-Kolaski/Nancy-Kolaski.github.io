# About Me  

<img src="assets/profile.jpeg" alt="About me" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">

##### I am a data analyst with a background in healthcare, inpatient therapy. My passion has always been in neurology since the brain uncovers the mysteries that define people/humanity. I'm excited to branch into this new role with a focus of studying data to uncover mysteries in a different way, revealing truths of the world. 

##### My curious nature has led me towards this career change with an eagerness to engage in the world of data analytics.  I have completed my certification through CareerFoundry, and I'm excited to put my skills to work!.  Scroll down to see my projects and skill set.

## **Instacart Basket Analysis**

[Check out my Instacart project in more detail](project1.md#project1)

Instacart is a well known and widely used online grocery shopping service looking to uncover more information on their sales patterns. This project from the CareerFoundry coursework was geared to introduce python to data analyst students.
  * Goal: Assist Instacart stakeholders to understand the variety of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors in order to develop targeted marketing strategies. The goal for this analysis is to ensure that Instacart targets the right customer profile with the appropriate products. They have specifically requested data regarding busiest times of day/days of the week, price range groupings on their products in order to simplify them, and departments/products that are most popular (most products sold).
