[Tableau Link for this project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nancy.kolaski/viz/PreparingforInfluenzaSeason_17109791937900/Story1)

The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in
the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff. The purpose of this analysis was to determine when to send staff, and how many, to each states. The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

## Goal: 
To help medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

## Hypothesis: 
If a person is 65+ years old, then they are more likely to die by flu.
