# Objective:
### ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organization, that is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.

# Hypotheses: 
### 1) ClimateWins can help predict climate change around Europe (and potentially, around the world).
### 2) The weather from ClimateWins locations are located at the top of a mountain and considered mostly ‘unpleasant’ conditions, and will therefore continue to be unpleasant in the future.
### 3) The weather climate across Europe will gradually increase over time.
### 4) Supervised & Unsupervised Learning algorithms are are optimal tools in predictive analysis needed for weather forecasting.

# Data: 
#### Data was collected between 1800s to 2022 by ‘European Climate Assessment and Data Set Project’ found at https://www.ecad.eu/
#### Data consisted of temperature, wind speed, snow, and global radiation from 18 different weather stations.

# Machine Learning Algorithms:
#### - Gradient Descent Optimization
#### - K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN)
#### - Artifical Neural Network (ANN)
#### - Decision Tree
#### - Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
#### - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
#### - Hierachical Clustering with Dendrograms
#### - Random Forests
#### - Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)

# Tools
#### For this project, the following python libraries were used:
  #### - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplot, os, operator
  #### - sklearn: .preprocessing, .metrics, .neural_netwrok, MLPCLassifier, .model_selection, train_test_split, .ensemble, tree import plot_tree, .model_selection 
  #### - RandomForestClassifier, GridSearchCV,  argmax, metrics
  #### - multilabel_confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, ConfusionMatrixDisplay, StandardScaler
  #### - tensorflow, keras (keras.models, keras.layers with LSTM), Sequential, Conv1D, Conv2D, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization, Flatten, MaxPooling1D
  #### - scipy: .cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage, fcluster
  #### - bayes_opt, BayesianOptimization, LeakyReLU, BatchNormalization



# Presentation 
#### There are two presentations available under the 'Presentations' folder: the first feature findings through supervised ML algorithms, and the second is mostly unsupervised ML.
