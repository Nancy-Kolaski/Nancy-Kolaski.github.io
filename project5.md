# Objective:
### ClimateWins is a European nonprofit organization, that is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.

- Identify weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
- Determine if unusual weather patterns are increasing.
- Generate possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends.
- Determine the safest places for people to live in Europe over the next 25 to 50 years.

  
# Hypotheses: 
### 1) ClimateWins can help predict climate change around Europe (and potentially, around the world).
### 2) The weather from ClimateWins locations are located at the top of a mountain and considered mostly ‘unpleasant’ conditions, and will therefore continue to be unpleasant in the future.
### 3) The weather climate across Europe will gradually increase over time.
### 4) Supervised & Unsupervised Learning algorithms are are optimal tools in predictive analysis needed for weather forecasting.

# Data: 
#### Data was collected between 1800s to 2022 by ‘European Climate Assessment and Data Set Project’ found at [https://www.ecad.eu/](https://www.ecad.eu/) 
#### Data consisted of temperature, wind speed, snow, and global radiation from 18 different weather stations.

# Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (KNN)
- Artifical Neural Network (ANN)
- Decision Tree
- Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Hierachical Clustering with Dendrograms
- Random Forests
- Generative Adversarial Network (GANs)
