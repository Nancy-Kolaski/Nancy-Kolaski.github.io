## Introduction:
GameCo is a video game company that wants to develop new games and establish better marketing strategies. Data analysis looked at different variables that impact sales such as genre/types of games, game platforms, publishers, sales across time (historical to 2016), and sales across geographical regions (North America, Europe, & Japan). The current understanding is that video game sales across global regions of Europe, North America, and Japan generally stay the same over time.
